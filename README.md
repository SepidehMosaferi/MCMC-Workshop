# MCMC-Workshop

This is a short description for the files of MCMC workshop. the workshop was presented at University of Maryland 
College Park by Sepideh Mosaferi dated November 2, 2016.

The workshop contains a pdf file as well as an R code. In the workshop, we give a short introduction to the simulation studies and
how we can install R program. 

The other brief contents are as follows:

[1] PART I: SIMPLE SIMULATIONS

We describe the methods of generating artificial populations under [model-based], [design-based], and
[model-design based] formats.

[2] PART II: ADVANCED SIMULATIONS

We introduce some of the codes related to MCMC, Monte Carlo integration, accept-reject algorithm, importance sampling
and optimization. Some details about the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, Gibbs samplers, and MCMC convergence will be provided.
